    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with parchment paper squares.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Grate cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl using a fine grater. Chop any remaining pieces too small to grate and add to the bowl.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cook in the microwave until cauliflower is soft and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour into a clean dish towel and let cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Wrap the towel around cauliflower and squeeze out as much liquid as possible; the drier, the better. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Combine squeezed cauliflower, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl until well combined. Scoop evenly into the prepared muffin cups. Pat down cauliflower mixture with the back of a spoon, making it compact.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and spoon pizza sauce evenly onto each crust. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let pizza bites sit in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove parchment paper from the bottoms and arrange bites on a platter. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>You can use a food processor to chop the cauliflower. Add small cauliflower chunks to the bowl and process until fine. </p>
    <p>You can add your favorite pizza toppings, chopped into small pieces, as step 8. </p>
