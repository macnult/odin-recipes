    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the cookies: Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Beat white sugar, butter, and vanilla in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until mixture is smooth. Gradually mix in flour mixture until a dough forms. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Form dough into a ball. Wrap ball with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes using desired cookie cutters. Arrange cookies on the prepared baking sheets. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown, about 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>While the cookies are cooling, make the icing: Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in a bowl using an electric mixer until well combined. Slowly beat in confectioners' sugar until icing is smooth. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Spread icing onto cooled cookies. </li>
        <p></p>
    </ol>
